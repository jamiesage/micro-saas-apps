# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** January 2026

This privacy policy explains how data is collected, used, and stored when you interact with @guildoftheamberpen on Instagram.

## What We Collect

When you comment on our Instagram posts, we collect:

- Your Instagram username
- Your comment text
- The number of likes on your comment
- The timestamp of your comment

This data is collected via the official Instagram Graph API from public comments on our posts.

## How We Use Your Data

Your comments are used to:

1. **Shape the story** — Comments suggesting story ideas are reviewed and may influence future chapters
2. **Credit contributors** — If your suggestion is used, your Instagram username may be mentioned in the post to acknowledge your contribution
3. **Improve engagement** — Like counts help us understand which ideas resonate with the community

## How It Works

Each day, an automated system:

1. Fetches the top comments (by likes) from our most recent post
2. Sends these comments to an AI service (Claude by Anthropic) to identify story-relevant suggestions
3. Uses selected suggestions to generate the next chapter of the story
4. Stores the comments locally for a limited amount of time

## Third-Party Services

Your comment data is processed by:

| Service | Purpose | Their Privacy Policy |
|---------|---------|---------------------|
| Anthropic (Claude) | AI analysis of comments* | [anthropic.com/privacy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy) |
| Black Forest Labs (FLUX) | Image generation | [https://bfl.ai/legal/privacy-policy](https://bfl.ai/legal/privacy-policy) |

These services receive only your username and comment text — no other personal information.

*AI analysis means: identifying story-relevant suggestions and generating further story text using the chosen comments.

## Data Storage

- Comments are stored on a private server located in the United Kingdom
- Data is retained for a limited time
- Data is not sold, shared, or used for advertising

## Your Rights

You can request to:

- **See your data** — Get a copy of any comments we've stored from you
- **Delete your data** — Have your comments removed from our records
- **Opt out of credits** — Ask not to be publicly credited even if your idea is used

To make a request, DM us on Instagram or email jamie@guildoftheamberpen.com.

## Public Nature of Comments

Remember that Instagram comments are public. By commenting on our posts, you're participating in a public conversation. Our use of your comments to influence a public story is an extension of this public interaction.

## Children

This project is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children. This is inline with Instagram's miminum age requirement.

## Changes

If this policy changes significantly, we'll announce it via Instagram post.
