# Part of the prompt for the Image Prompt Writer

## Visual Storytelling from the Prose

1. NEGATIVE SPACE
Identify what's absent or implied in the chapter—consider whether the image should capture presence or absence (empty chair, untouched food, shadow without source).

2. ENVIRONMENT AS EMOTION
Match the setting's visual mood to the emotional beat:
- Tension: close, heavy, still air, oppressive light
- Relief: open sky, movement, breathing room
- Loss: empty spaces where things should be

3. SINGLE FOCAL OBJECT
Identify the chapter's most significant object (the blue train case, the fake alligator shoes, the cracked pot). Consider centering an image on this object rather than characters.
